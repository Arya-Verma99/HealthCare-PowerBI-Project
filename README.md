# HealthCare Power BI Project
This Power BI project explores healthcare data to gain insights into treatment effectiveness, hospital costs, recovery ratings, and patient admission trends across different age groups and time periods.

## Project Objective
To analyze and visualize healthcare data to:
- Evaluate treatment outcomes and recovery ratings
- Understand hospital cost distribution
